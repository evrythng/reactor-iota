# reactor-iota

This Reactor Extension script is part of
[EVRYTHNG's Blockchain Integration Hub](https://developers.evrythng.com/docs/blockchain-integration-hub).
It can be used to send EVRYTHNG
[actions](https://developers.evrythng.com/reference/actions) to the
[IOTA](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/) Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and its networks.

IOTA is an open source DLT that enables sharing of any type of data (including IoT data) guaranteeing traceability of their source, alongside with integrity and immutability of the shared information, and dedicated access management, e.g., who can read what. In contrast with traditional blockchain-based DLTs, IOTA is based on a Directed Acyclic Graph, the Tangle. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWqqfzunhI) explains how the IOTAâ€™s Tangle works. 

The [IOTA Streams](https://github.com/iotaledger/streams) second layer protocol 
is used to create chains of messages anchored to the Tangle. 
The [anchors]https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tangle-js/anchors) library 
facilitates getting access to the IOTA Streams functionality through the abstraction of an "Anchoring Channel". 

## Configure

1.  Deploy this Reactor script in an application within a project, not
    forgetting to specify the `dependencies` in `package.json`.
2.  You can specify a `NODE_ADDRESS`, otherwise `https://chrysalis-nodes.iota.org` will be used (see _Testing_ below).
3.  Ensure that the `CONFIRMATION_ACTION_TYPE` action type exists in the same
    project as the EVRYTHNG application hosting the Reactor script.

## Use

The script will react to actions with a `sendToIOTA=true` custom field
and will record a transaction for the action on the IOTA Distributed Ledger (DLT).
The script will record transactions on the Chrysalis *mainnet* default nodes (hosted 
by the IOTA Foundation) unless a specific node is defined bt the `NODE_ADDRESS` setting. 

You can include any extra custom fields that you may
require in addition to the one mentioned here. The target of the original action
can be either a Thng, product, or collection.

Once the script has run, the resulting `channelID`, `seed` and `publicKey` are added
to the target Thng, product, or collection's custom fields under a dictionary named 
`iotaAnchoringChannel`. The `channelID` is the combination of the channel address 
and the initial anchorage (announce message) provided by the anchoring 
channel associated to the target. The `seed` is the secret used to create such a channel 
and to anchor action's hashes. Such seed is used to generate an Ed25519 key pair which 
public key component is stored under the `publicKey` custom field. The public key allows
 to verify the authenticity of the anchored messages when fetched. 

Last but not least, the `iotaAnchoringChannel` dictionary contains the `nextAnchorageID`
member which allows the Reactor script to continue anchoring messages to the same IOTA Streams
channel  (i.e.: in a single chain) on subsequent invocations. This allows the anchoring channel 
to closely resemble the target's action history.


## Testing

Once the script is installed, test it by creating an action with the correct
custom field specified on a `Thng`, `product`, or `collection` in the project's scope,
for example:

```json
{
  "type": "_ItemShipped",
  "thng": "UKn4wYKEYyQnc2aawGhytBfc",
  "customFields": {
    "sendToIOTA": true
  }
}
```

The confirmation action created by the script will contain the channelID, as well as a pointer to the original action that triggered the script:

```json
{
    "type": "_sentToIOTA",
    "id": "VasQR7nVxNMmYMUNxYMwpFap",
    "createdAt": 1626279332221,
    "customFields": {
        "channelID": "5f9bf50c1e569935e8dee6885623b218653bec4974336f35bb496799479f6dbe0000000000000000:0e39dbea0bf5ded36b7ae626",
        "originalAction": {
            "id": "Vw8Qw7Ha7gNsSfg2MNChAqQe",
            "type": "_bottleOpened"
        },
        "publicKey": "5f9bf50c1e569935e8dee6885623b218653bec4974336f35bb496799479f6dbe"
    },

        "longitude": -77.4728,
        "position": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                -77.4728,
                39.0481
            ]
        }
    },
    "locationSource": "geoIp",
    "createdByProject": "Vwrya4hYsEXpPxcxtxGEHrHa",
    "createdByApp": "VasP3WkKBDTfT9Ertk4abmQb",
    "thng": "Vw89wM7ntBfq9FVeEy9EYqbm",
    "product": "VRNr4p4ysF5FBFCHMPRNehnh"
}
```

You can also inspect the anchoring channel content by using the [tangle-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tangle-js/tangle-cli) tool. For instance, 


```console
tcli channel inspect --channelID="0d00913710aa876fadfb7aa3a7c1f99399dea03c442111f82976bf41df9dd0b50000000000000000:99c47f5045a0b27876a68087" --seed=jjfwzxqfmbpqiqrqiyntmdtucqxfgwapzciywutlarkzbixerisfqlxkqsgajvpyofmuktweqltnniup --mainnet
```
